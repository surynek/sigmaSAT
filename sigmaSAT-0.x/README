------------------------------

An experimental package for solving
Boolean satisfiability an to conduct
experiments with it.

Currently, it comprises of three
modules:

encodeSIGMA
-----------
  Collection of functions for
  generating bit-wise arithmetic
  operators and relations as Boolean
  formulas.

  usage: encodeSIGMA


localSIGMA
----------
  A local search based SAT solver. The
  main framework is based on WalkSAT.
  One-literal watching is used to
  speed-up search for satisfied and
  unsatisfied clauses.

  usage: localSIGMA [FILE]
    where FILE is a file in the DIMACS
    .cnf format


systemSIGMA
-----------
  A systematic conflict directed DPLL based
  SAT solver. Two-literal watching scheme is
  implemented. Currently, no heuristics
  and no clause learning is implemented.

  usage: systemSIGMA [FILE]
    where FILE is a file in the DIMACS
    .cnf format
